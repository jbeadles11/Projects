OVERVIEW:
This project involves a financial analysis of a fitness company's revenues and expenses. I cleaned and manipulated the data in PowerQuery before importing it into PowerBI to derive meaningful insights from the data. 
The following is an outline of the steps I took.

CLEANING:
- Data Separation: Created a separate expense and revenue column from the original amount column. I did this by verifying if the value in the amount was identified as an expense or revenue in the "Revenue or Expense" column.
- Data Removal: Deleted the month sequence column, due to repetitiveness in the original dataset.
- Null Values: All zero values in the newly created expense and revenue columns were replaced with nulls to allow for easier analysis within these columns.

DATA IMPORT PROCESS
1. Took the cleaned dataset from Microsoft Excel and exported it to be ready for import into PowerBI.
2. Utilized "Import data from Excel option"
3. Double-checked the imported data to certify it was the right dataset. 

MANIPULATION IN POWERBI:
Created measures/filtered measures for: 
- Gross Profit (Revenue - COGS Expense)
- Net Profit (Revenue - Expense)
- EBIT (Revenue - OPEX and COGS expense)
- Revenue MoM%
- Cost of Goods Sold Expense
- Interest and Tax Expense
- Operating Expenses Expense
Measures for Visualization purposes:
For certain visualizations, I utilized the absolute value of some measures to be better represented in graphs:
- Absolute Cost of Goods Sold
- Absolute Expenses
- Absolute Interest and Tax
- Absolute Operating Expense


REVENUE GROUPS:
- Sales
- Other Income
- Consulting and Professional Services

EXPENSE GROUPS:
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): Labor, Materials, Other, Packaging, Shipping
- Operating Expenses (OPEX): Equipment, Marketing, Other, Payroll, Rent, Research and Development (R&D)
- Interest and Tax

BUSINESS LINES:
- Sportswear
- Nutrition and Food Supplements
- Sports Equipment
