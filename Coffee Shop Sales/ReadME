OVERVIEW
In this project, I transformed a Coffee shop sales dataset into an dynamic dashboard in Microsoft Excel. This dashboard enables users to analyze and extract insights from data covering January to June to better assist the business. I utilized Excel's PowerQuery for data import and levereaged Excel's visualization tools to create the dynamic dashboard.

CLEANING/TRANSFORMATION
1. Created a new revenue column from the unit_price and transaction_qty column
2. Calculated four new columns based on the transaction_date column; Month ( =MONTH() ), Weekday ( =WEEKDAY( ,2) ), Month Name ( =TEXT( ,"mmm") ), and Weekday Name ( =TEXT( ,"ddd") )
3. Using transaction_time column, created an hour column utilizing the =HOUR() function

RECOMMENDATIONS
- Analyze trends and insights for the slow start to the year (January to March). Further analyze how to maximize profits in the highest revenue months, May and June. 
- Look into adopting Astoria's 7am to 7pm schedule. Hell's Kitchen has the lowest amount of sales at 8pm, only completing 528 transactions across a six month period. Consider closing the Lower Manhattan store two hours earlier as there are only a combined 200 total transactions during these hours. Look at offering promotions and deals to boost profits at these popular hours.
- Analyze pricing of branded merchandise. Understanding the factors behind selling fewer than 1000 items can help increase profits and spread the reach of the brand.
