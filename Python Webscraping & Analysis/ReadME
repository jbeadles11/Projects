Webscraping and Analyzing Premier League data (2021-2024)
(Educational purposes only)

OVERVIEW
This project focuses on web scraping and analysis of Premier League data (2021-2024). The data was scraped from fbref.com and contains a various match performance values.
I used BeautifulSoup to web scrape three separate web pages which were then exported into csv format for analysis.

DATA PREPARATION
- Combined three separate dataframes into one single dataframe
- Analyzed the size, columns, and data types of the dataframe
- Created a new data column by converting the original date format into a time-based datatype.
- Extracted the year from the converted date column
- Created a converted date column off the original date column to change the datatype
- Extracted the year from the converted date column
- Used str.split() to separate home and away scores from the 'Score' column
- Checked for null values and populated them with the relevant values

ANALYSIS
- Computed overall averages for home and away expected goals
- Created a histogram to visualize home and away xG distribution as well as stadium attendance
- Developed a countplot to visualize referee involvement in the games
- Analyzed correlations between xG_H, xG_A, and Attendance
- Evaluated each team's home, away, and overall xG further grouping this by year in the dataset
- Generated stripplots to visualize distribution of home and away xG for each team
- Identified teams that created the most chances at home, away and overall
- Analyzed teams' performance at home vs. away and assessed if teams overperformed or underperformed utilizing actual match scores from the dataset

CONCLUSIONS
- Home teams exhibited higher xG figures compared to away teams, with home teams creating 1.60 xG compared to away teams creating 1.27 xG.
- Overall, teams performed better at home, with the exception of Leicester City and Watford.
- Liverpool and Manchester City led in total xG, with values of 248.0 and 247.8. 
- It is important to note that, attendance did not have any correlation with higher xG_H or lower xG_A.
- Manchester City and Liverpool consistently recorded the highest home xG and away xG, while Arsenal had the highest overall average xG. 
- Despite an xG overperformance, Manchester City and Arsenal remained among the top clubs in the Premier League. 
- In contrast, Luton Town's 1.23 xG overperformance resulted in them being relegated.
